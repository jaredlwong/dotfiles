# - This is read first and read every time, regardless of the shell being
#   login, interactive, or none.
# - This is the recommended place to set environment variables, though I still
#   prefer to set my environment variables in .zprofile
# - Why would you need it? Because, for example, if you have a script that gets
#   called by launchd, it will run under non-interactive non-login shell, so
#   neither .zshrc nor .zprofile will get loaded.
#
# ~/.zshenv should only be a one-liner that sources this file
